### Output

The directory structure mirrors the `src` folder found in the root directoy in which the source code is located, to make it easy to find any file outputs for the different notebooks and python files.

Note that per default, although `training_checkpoints` of tensorflow are stored at runtime in this directory, all of those are ignored and not pushed to reduce the clutter.
